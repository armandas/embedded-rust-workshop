# LCD

We have finally reached the point where we can start playing with the main feature of our development board — the LCD.

For this workshop, we will not be using the previous project, but will start afresh. To save time on the boilerplate,
I have prepared a template repository that has the display setup already done. Go ahead and clone it, then we'll
talk through the initialization steps.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/armandas/esp32-c6-lcd-template.git hello_display
```

Then open the project by opening the directory `hello_display` with your favourite editor (e.g. `code hello_display`).
