# IMU

In this workshop, we work with the [IMU][1] . Unlike the previous workshops, however,
we will not be using an existing crate, but will develop a basic driver ourselves.
There are a couple of reasons for this:

1. At the time of writing, there's no library on crates.io available for our IMU (QMI8658A).
2. It's a fun and useful topic to explore.
